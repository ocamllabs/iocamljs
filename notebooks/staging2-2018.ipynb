Many\nof the most commonly-used types and operations -- lists with\ncatenation, functions with composition, integers with multiplication,\nand so on -- form monoids.  In some cases, the partially-static\nstructure `ps_cmonoid` from the [previous notebook](staging.html) can\n(with a little generalization) be used to optimize multi-stage\nprograms that work with these monoids.\n\nHowever, since `ps_cmonoid` assumes that the underlying monoid is\n*commutative*, there are many monoids for which it cannot be used.\nFor example, strings with catenation form a non-commutative monoid:\n\n`\"a\" ^ \"b\"` ≢ `\"b\" ^ \"a\"`\n\nas do matrices with multiplication and functions with composition.\n\nIn order to optimize programs that use non-commutative monoids we will\nneed a new partially-static structure.\n\n### Other algebraic structures\n\nSimilarly, many programs use structures that are richer than\ncommutative monoids --- i.e. they have additional operations and\naddional laws.  For example, integers together with both\nmultiplication and addition form a (commutative) ring.\n\nThe `PS_monoid` interface generalizes straightforwardly to other\nstructures.  For an algebraic signature `S` with an implementation\n`M`, we can define `PS_S` as follows:\n\n```\nmodule type PS_S = sig\n type ps\n module N: S with type t = ps\n val dyn: M.t code -> ps\n val sta: M.t      -> ps\n val eva: {O:S} -> (M.t code -> O.t) -> (M.t -> O.t) ->\n   ps -> O.t\nend\n```\n\nThat is, for any algebraic signature `S` the corresponding partially\nstatic structure has the same interface:\n\n* a partially-static type `ps`, such that\n\n* there is an instance of `S` for `ps`.  (That is,\n  the partially-static `MONOID` is a `MONOID`,\n  the partially-static `RING` is a `RING`, and so on.)\n\n* there are injections `dyn` and `sta` from dynamic and static values\n  into `ps`, and\n  \n* there is a fold-like function `eva` that eliminates a\n  partially-static value into any other instance of `S`.\n\nReplacing `S` with `MONOID` turns `PS_S` back into the less general\n`PS_monoid` interface; replacing `S` with other signatures such as\n`RING`, `GROUP`, or `LATTICE` gives an interface suitable for\nprogramming with partially-static versions of those structures.\n\n### Working out the representation\n\nThe *interface* for partially-static algebraic structures is uniform,\nbut there is significant variation in the *implementations* for the\nvarious algebras.  There follows a brief sketch of how the\nimplementation for a particular structure is determined.  (The draft\npaper [Partially-static data as free extension of\nalgebras](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/partially-static-data-as-free-extension-of-algebras-draft.pdf)\ngives more details.)\n\nAn partially-static expression is built from a set of operations,\nconstants (known values) and variables (unknown values):\n\n```\n(2 ⊕ x) ⊕ (4 ⊕ y)\n```\n\nThe **laws** for an algebraic structure make certain expressions\nequivalent, so that expressions can be grouped into equivalence\nclasses.\n\nFor example, the monoid associativity law makes all of the following\nexpressions equivalent:\n\n```\n(2 ⊕ x) ⊕ (4 ⊕ y)\n((2 ⊕ x) ⊕ 4) ⊕ y\n2 ⊕ ((x ⊕ 4) ⊕ y)\n...\n```\n\nThe laws allow us to represent only a subset of possible expressions:\nwe can pick a **canonical representative** of each equivalence class.\n\nFor monoids, every expression can be fully left- or right- associated;\nwe pick the right-associated form as the canonical representative:\n\n```\n2 ⊕ (x ⊕ (4 ⊕ y))\n```\n\nThat is, while expressions built from the binary operator `⊕` form\n*trees*, the canonical representation of any expressions is a *list*.\n\nFinally, adjacent constants can be combined. For example, for the\nmonoid of strings with catenation, adjacent constant (i.e. static)\nstrings can be catenated:\n\n```\nx ^ (\"a\" ^ (\"b\" ^ y))\n  ≡\n  x ^ (\"ab\" ^ y)\n```\n\nThese considerations lead to the partially-static representation for\nmonoids: a sequence with **no adjacent static elements**\n\n**Commutative monoids**, such as integers with multiplication, have an\nextra law: the order of elements is irrelevant.  Adding in this extra\nlaw collapses equivalence classes that were previously distinct.  And\nthe canonical representation changes, too, since commutativity makes\nit possible to reorder the elements in a list to bring together and\nthen combine all the static elements (constants).\n\nOnce again, the partially-static structure only needs to represent the\ncanonical form for commutative monoid expressions: a pair of a\n**single static** element (produced by combining all the constants in\nthe expression) and an unordered **bag of variables** (i.e. all the\nvariables in the expression).\n\n### Programming with partially-static monoids\n\nHere is an OCaml implementation of partially-static monoids (a\nsequence with no adjacent static elements):"},{"metadata":{},"input":"type sta = Sta and dyn = Dyn and eseq = E: _ seq -> eseq\nand _ seq =  (* sta seq begins with a static element *)\n    Empty : _ seq\n  | ConsS : string      * dyn seq -> sta seq\n  | ConsD : string code *  _  seq -> dyn seq","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nFor simplicity the implementation is specialized to the monoid of\nstrings with catenation.\n\nThe type `seq` is indexed by the binding-time of its head: either\nstatic (`sta`) or dynamic (`dyn`).\nThere are three constructors:\n\n* An `Empty` sequence can be treated as either static or dynamic\n* A `ConsS` value combines a single static element with a `dyn`-headed\n  sequence\n* A `ConsD` value combines a single dynamic element with a sequence\n  (which may be either `sta`- or `dyn`-headed)\n\nThe existential type `eseq` hides the index of `seq`.\n\nIt is convenient to define functions `consS` and `dynS` that\nrespectively cons a static or dynamic element onto an `eseq` value:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"let consS : string -> eseq -> eseq =\n  fun x xs -> match xs with\n    | E Empty -> E (ConsS (x, Empty))\n    | E (ConsS (y, ys)) -> E (ConsS (x ^ y, ys))\n    | E (ConsD (_,_) as r) -> E (ConsS (x, r))","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":">"},{"metadata":{},"input":"let consD : string code -> eseq -> eseq =\n  fun x (E xs) -> E (ConsD (x, xs))","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nUsing `consS` and `consD` we can define the monoid operator for\npartially-static strings:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"let rec (<*>) : eseq -> eseq -> eseq =\n  fun (E l) r -> match l with\n   | Empty -> r\n   | ConsS (h, t) -> consS h (E t <*> r)\n   | ConsD (h, t) -> consD h (E t <*> r)","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nIt is straightforward to build an implementation of `PS_monoid` using\nthese definitions:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"module PS_string =\nstruct\n  type ps = eseq\n  module N = struct\n    type t = ps\n    let unit = Empty\n    let (<*>) = (<*>)\n  end\n  let dyn d = consD d (E Empty)\n  let sta s = consS s (E Empty)\n  let rec eva : {O:MONOID} -> (string code -> O.t) -> (string -> O.t) -> ps -> O.t\n    = fun {O:MONOID} f g e  -> match e with\n        E Empty -> O.unit\n     | E (ConsS (h, Empty)) -> g h\n     | E (ConsD (h, Empty)) -> f h\n     | E (ConsS (h, t)) -> O.(g h <*> eva f g (E t))\n     | E (ConsD (h, t)) -> O.(f h <*> eva f g (E t))\nend","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nAnd the function `cd` that turns a `PS_string.ps` value into code can be written as follows:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"module Code_string_monoid = struct\n  type t = string code\n  let unit = .<\"\">.\n  let (<*>) l r = .< .~l ^ .~r >.\nend\nlet cd = PS_string.eva {Code_string_monoid} (fun d -> d) (fun s -> .<s>.)","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nTo show partially-static monoids in action we will look at a simple\nimplementation of a typed `printf` function.\n\n(The technique used to write `printf` here scales up well: it is also\nused to implement fully-featured formatting modules in the OCaml\nstandard library; the implementation there involves over 6000 lines of\nformatting code!)\n\nThe first component of `printf` is a representation of \"format\nstrings\" as a GADT:"},{"metadata":{},"input":" type (_,_) fmt =\n   | Int : (int -> 'a, 'a) fmt\n   | Lit : string -> ('a, 'a) fmt\n   | Bool : (bool -> 'a, 'a) fmt\n   | Cat : ('a,'b) fmt * ('b,'c) fmt -> ('a,'c) fmt\n let (%) x y = Cat (x, y)","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nThere are two parameters: the first represents the overall type of the\nformat string, and the second represents its result type.
