However, this style leads to problems when the definition of one\nsuch `t` must refer to another.\n\nFor example, in the following code, `t1` and `t2` cannot both be\nrenamed `t`, since both names are used within a single scope, where\nall occurrences of `t` must refer to the same type."},{"metadata":{},"input":"  type t1 = A\n  module M = struct\n    type t2 = B of t2 * t1 | C\n  end","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nThe extended `open` construct resolves the difficulty,\nmaking it possible to give an unexported local alias for the outer\n`t`:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"  type t = A\n  module M = struct\n    open struct type t' = t end\n    type t = B of t * t' | C\n  end","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Local definitions scoped over several functions \nA common pattern involves defining one or more local definitions for\nuse within one more more exported functions. \n(See [`draw_poly`, `draw_poly_line` and `dodraw`][graphics-example] in the OCaml `Graphics` module for an\n  example.)\n\nTypically, the exported functions are defined using tuple pattern\nmatching.  Here is an example, defining `f` and\n`g`  in terms of an auxiliary unexported function,\n`aux`:\n\n```\n  let f, g =\n    let aux x y =\n        ... \n    in (fun p -> aux p true),\n       (fun p -> aux p false)\n```\n\nThis style has several drawbacks:\n\n* the names `f` and `g` are separated from their definitions by the\n  definition of `aux`;\n\n* the unsugared syntax `fun x -> ... ` must be used in place of the\n  sugared syntax `let f x = ... `; and\n\n* the definition allocates an intermediate tuple.\n\nWith extended `open`, these problems disappear:\n\n```\n  include struct\n    open struct let aux x y =  ...  end\n    let f p = aux p true\n    let g p = aux p false\n  end\n```\n\n#### Local exception definitions \nOCaml's `let module` construct supports defining exceptions\nwhose names are visible only within a particular\nexpression.  (OCaml 4.04 adds a [more direct][gpr-638] construct.)\n\nLimiting the scope of exceptions supports a\n[common idiom][exceptions-are-shared-secrets] in which exceptions are\nused to pass information between a raiser and a handler without the\npossibility of interception.\n(This idiom is perhaps even more useful for\n[programming with effects][ocaml-effects], where information flows in both\ndirections.)\n\nLimiting the scope of exceptions can make control flow easier to\nunderstand and, in principle, easier to optimize; in some cases,\nlocally-scoped exceptions [can be compiled using local jumps][gpr-638].\n\nThe extended `open` construct improves support for this\npattern.  While `let module` allows defining exceptions\nwhose names are visible only within particular expressions, extended\n`open` also allows limiting visibility to particular\ndeclarations.\n\nFor example, in the following code, the `Interrupt`\nexception is only visible within the bindings for `loop` and\n`run`:\n\n```\n  include struct\n    open struct exception Interrupt end\n    let rec loop () = ... raise Interrupt\n    let rec run = match loop () with\n      | exception Interrupt -> Error \"failed\"\n      | x -> Ok x\n  end\n```\n\n\n\n#### Shared state\n\nSimilarly, extended `open` supports limiting the scope of global state\nto a particular set of declarations:"},{"metadata":{},"input":" open struct\n   open struct let counter = ref 0 end\n   let inc () = incr counter\n   let dec () = decr counter\n   let current () = !counter\n end","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n#### It is sometimes useful to import a module under a restricted signature \n\n(Drawn from a [proposal][leo-proposal] by Leo White on the compiler hacking tasks.)\n\nFor example, the statement\n\n```\nopen (Option : MONAD)\n```\n\nimports only those identifiers from\nthe `Option` module that appear in the `MONAD`\nsignature.\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"section:signature-use-cases\"></a>\n## Extended `open` in signatures: examples\n\nIn signatures, as in structures, the argument of `open` is\ncurrently restricted to a qualified module path.\n\nAs in structures, we propose extending `open` in signatures\nto allow an arbitrary module expression as argument.\n\nHowever, while extended `open` in structures evaluates its\nargument; `open` in signatures is used only during type\nchecking.\n\nThis section presents examples of signatures that benefit from extended `open`.\n\nOur examples all involve type definitions, but it is possible to\nconstruct similar examples for other language constructs, such as\nfunctors and classes.\n\n#### Unwriteable, unprintable signatures\n\nThe OCaml compiler has a feature that is often useful during\ndevelopment: passing the `-i` flag when compiling a module causes\nOCaml to display the inferred signature of the module.\n\nHowever, users are sometimes surprised when a signature generated by\nOCaml is subsequently rejected by OCaml, because it is incompatible\nwith the original module, or even because it is invalid when\nconsidered in isolation.\n\nHere is an example of the first case.  For the following module:\n\n```\n  type t = T1\n  module M = struct\n    type t = T2\n    let f T1 = T2\n  end\n```\n\n`ocamlc -i` prints the following signature:\n\n```\ntype t = T1\nmodule M : sig\n  type t = T2\n  val f : t -> t\nend\n```\n\nThe input and output types of `M.f` are different in the\nmodule, but printed identically.\n\nThat is, the printed type for `f` is incorrect.\n\nHere is an example of the second case.  For the following module\n\n```\ntype t = T\nmodule M = struct\n  type 'a t = 'a\n  let f T = T\nend\n```\n\n`ocamlc -i` prints the following signature:\n\n```\ntype t = T\nmodule M : sig\n  type 'a t = 'a\n  val f : t -> t\n end\n```\n\nThis time the generated signature is ill-formed because the type\n`M.t` requires a type argument, but is used without one.\n\nIf these problems arose from a shortcoming in the implementation of\nthe `-i` flag then there would be little cause for\nconcern.\n\nIn fact, they point to a more fundamental issue: many OCaml\nmodules have signatures that cannot be given a printed representation.\n\nIt is impossible to generate suitable signatures; more\nimportantly, it is impossible even to write down suitable signatures\nby hand.\n\nThe problem in both cases is scoping: an identifier such as\n`t` always refers to the most recent definition, and there\nis no way to refer to other bindings for the same name.\n\nThe `nonrec` keyword, introduced in OCaml 4.02.2, solves a\nfew special cases of the problem, by making it possible to refer to a\nsingle other definition for `t` within the definition of\n`t` itself.\n\nBut most such problems, including the examples above, are not solved\nby `nonrec`.\n\nThe extended `open` solves the problem entirely,\nby making it possible to give internal aliases to names.\n\nFor example, here is a valid signature for the first case above using\nextended `open`.\n\n```\ntype t = T1\nopen struct type t' = t end\nmodule M : sig\n  type t = T2\n  val f : t' -> t\nend\n```\n\nThe OCaml compiler might similarly insert a minimal set of aliases to\nresolve shadowing without the need for user intervention.\n\nAnd, of course, extended `open` also makes it possible for\nusers to write those signatures that are currently inexpressible.\n\n\n\n\n#### Local type alias in a signature\nEven in cases with no shadowing, it is sometimes useful to define a\nlocal type alias in a signature (For example, the functions\n`comment`,\n`maintainer`,\n `run`,\n `cmd`,\n `user`,\n`workdir`,\n `volume`, and\n `entrypoint` in the [Dockerfile module][dockerfile-module] would benefit from such an alias.). In the following code, the type\n`t` is available for use in `x` and `y`,\nbut not exported from the signature.\n\n```\n  open struct type t = int -> int end\n  val x : t\n  val y : t\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"section:restrictions\"></a>\n## Restrictions and design considerations\n\n#### Dependency elimination\n\nOCaml's applicative functors impose a number of restrictions on\nprograms beyond type compatibility.\n\nOne such restriction arises in functor application: types defined in\n[the argument of a functor must be ``eliminable'' in the result][modular-modules].\n\nFor example, given the following functor definition"},{"metadata":{},"input":"module F(X: sig type t val x: t end) =\n   struct let x = X.x end","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nthe following application is not allowed"},{"metadata":{},"input":"F(struct type t = T let x = T end);;","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nsince the result of the application cannot be given a type, as there\nis no suitable name for the type of `x`.\n\nThe extended `open` construct has a similar restriction.\n\nFor example, the following program is rejected by the\ntype-checker because the only suitable name for the type of `x`,\nnamely `t`, is not exported:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"open struct type t = T end\nlet x = T","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nHere is the error message from the compiler:\n\n```\nError: The module identifier M#0 cannot be\n          eliminated from val x : M#0.t\n```\n\n\n#### Evaluation of extended `open` in signatures\n\nHere is a possible objection to supporting the extended\n`open` in signatures: although local type definitions are\nuseful within signatures, local value definitions are not, and so it\nwould be better to restrict the argument of `open` to permit\nonly type definitions.\n\nFor example, the following runs without raising an exception:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"module type S =  (* no exception! *)\n  sig open struct assert false end end","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nWithin a signature, `open`'s argument is used only for its type, and so the expression `assert false` is not evaluated.\n\nIn fact, this behaviour follows an existing principle of OCaml's design: _module expressions in type contexts are not evaluated_.\n\nFor example, the `module type of` construct, currently supported in OCaml, also accepts a module expression that is not evaluated:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"module type S = (* no exception! *)\n  module type of struct assert false end","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nAnd similarly, functor applications that occur within type expressions\nin OCaml are not evaluated:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"module F(X: sig end) =\n   struct assert false type t = int end\n let f (x: F(List).t) = x (* no exception! *)","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n[modular-modules]: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0956796800003683\n[dockerfile-module]: https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-dockerfile/blob/e0dad1a/src/dockerfile.mli\n[leo-proposal]: https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on#signatured-open-command\n[gpr-638]: https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/638\n[gpr-301]: https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/301\n[shared-secrets]: https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/exceptions-are-shared-secrets/\n[ocaml-effects]: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/effective-concurrency-through-algebraic-effects.pdf\n[graphics-example]: https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/4697ca14/otherlibs/graph/graphics.ml#L105-L118"}],"metadata":{}}],"nbformat":3,"nbformat_minor":0}
