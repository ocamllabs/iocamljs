Abstraction helps to make\nprograms more general and more robust, but often comes with a performance\ncost.  *Staging* is one way of eliminating this cost, making it possible to\ncombine abstraction with efficiency.\n\n### Abstraction and optimization opportunities\n\nAbstraction can reduce the efficiency of a program in a number of ways.\nAbstraction boundaries sometimes make code harder for a compiler to optimize.\n\nHere is a definition of a function, `both_eq1`, which compares pairs of\nintegers for equality:\n\n```\nlet both_eq1 : int * int -> int * int -> bool =\n  fun (x1, y1) (x2, y2) ->\n   x1 = x2 && y1 = y2\n```\n\nThe OCaml compiler will compile `both_eq1` to efficient code, specializing\nsand inlining the polymorphic equality operation with an equality test that\noperates on values that are known to be integers.\n\nWe can make the function more general by abstracting the equality test.  Here\nis a second function, `both_eq2`, which accepts the integer equality test as\nan argument:\n\n```\nlet both_eq2 : (int -> int -> bool) ->\n  int * int -> int * int -> bool =\n  fun eq (x1, y1) (x2, y2) ->\n    eq x1 x2 && eq y1 y2\n```\n\nAnd here is a call to `both_eq2`, passing in the equality test as an argument:\n\n```\nboth_eq2 (=)\n```\n\nAs before, the OCaml compiler will inline and specialize the equality test in\nthis call.  However, calling a function passed as argument is less efficient\nthan calling a function directly, so `both_eq2` is less efficient than\n`both_eq1`.\n\nWe can introduce even more abstraction into the program by making the equality\nfunction passed as argument polymorphic.  OCaml doesn't support passing\npolymorphic functions directly, but we can pass a record with a polymorphic\nfield.  Here is a third implementation, `both_eq3`, which accepts such a\npolymorphic argument:\n\n```\ntype eq = { eq: 'a. 'a -> 'a -> bool }\nlet both_eq3 {eq} (x1, y1) (x2, y2) =\n  eq x1 x2 && eq y1 y2\n```\n\nAnd here is a call to `both_eq3`:\n\n```\nboth_eq3 { eq = (=) }\n```\n\nSince the equality function is passed as a polymorphic function rather than as\na function that operates on integers the OCaml compiler is unable to replace\nit with a type-specialized version, and so `both_eq3` is less efficient again\nthan `both_eq2`.\n\n### Interpretative overhead\n\n*Interpretative overhead* is a second way in which abstraction can make\nprograms less efficient.  Interpretative overhead occurs when a program must\nexamine a data structure in order to determine which action to perform.  For\nexample, the `printf` family of functions typically involve a certain amount\nof interpretative overhead, since they operate by interpreting a format string\nwhen the program runs.  Here is a function which prints out a pair of integers\nas a string using `printf`:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"let print_int_pair (x,y) =\n  Printf.printf \"(%d,%d)\" x y","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nThis function is less efficient than the following equivalent but less elegant\nimplementation, which simply calls a number of primitive functions directly:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"let print_int_pair2 (x,y) =\n  print_char '(';\n  print_int x;\n  print_char ',';\n  print_int y;\n  print_char ')'","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nAs with `both_eq`, we can also write even more general (and even less\nefficient) implementations by abstracting further.  Here is a definition of\n`print_int_pair` that uses the generic programming library introduced in the\nprevious lecture:\n\n```\nlet print_int_pair3 (x,y) =\n   print_string (gshow.q (pair int int) (x, y))\n```\n\nThis implementation is even less efficient than `print_int_pair` because there\nis an extra level of indirection: `gshow` is implemented in terms of `gmapQ`,\nwhich is difficult to optimize because it is so highly polymorphic.\n\n### Abstraction wants to be free\n\nLet's start with a simple example to see how staging can improve the\nefficiency of programs.

The last case is only\ndetected dynamically, when the `!.` function is executed.\n\n### The idealized staging process:\n\nThe process of specializing a function using staging often follows the same\npattern:\n\n1. Write the program as usual, without staging constructs.\n\n   Here is the signature for an unstaged function with some static inputs (of\n   some type `t_sta`) and some dynamic inputs (of some type `t_dyn`):\n\n   ```\n   val program : t_sta -> t_dyn -> t\n   ```\n\n   In our original `pow` function all of `t_sta` (the exponent) and `t_dyn`\n   (the base) and `t` (the result type) were `int`.\n\n2. Add staging annotations, changing the dynamic variables into variables of\n   type `t_dyn code` and the output into type `t code`.\n\n   ```\n   val staged_program : t_sta -> t_dyn code -> t code\n   ```\n\n   At this point we have changed the original function into a code generator\n\n3. Compile the code using `back`:\n\n   ```\n   val back: ('a code -> 'b code) -> ('a -> 'b) code\n   ```\n\n   The `back` function turns a function from `code` to `code` into a closed\n   piece of code.  We might define `back` as follows:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"let back f = .< fun x -> .~(f .< x >.) >.","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n   There is a companion function `forth` of type\n\n   ```\n   val forth: ('a -> 'b) code -> 'a code -> 'b code\n   ```\n\n   whose definition is left as an exercise.\n\n   In the `pow` example above we didn't use `back` explicitly.  Instead\n   we inlined the definition of `back` in the function `pow_code`.\n\n   Combining `back` with the code generator of step 2 gives a function of type\n\n   ```\n   val code_generator : t_sta -> (t_dyn -> t) code\n   ```\n\n4. Construct the static inputs:\n\n   ```\n   val s : t_sta\n   ```\n\n   In order to generate code we must supply the static arguments to the code\n   generator.  In the `pow` example constructing the static arguments is easy,\n   since they're just integers.  In other cases this step can be more involved.\n\n5. Apply the code generator to static inputs:\n\n   ```\n   val specialized_code : (t_dyn -> t) code\n   ```\n\n   Applying the `code_generator` function to the static inputs produces a piece\n   of specialized code.\n\n6. Run the specialized code to build a specialized function:\n\n   Running (evaluating) the code generated in the previous step produces a\n   function that can be used in the program:\n\n   ```\n   val specialized_function : t_dyn -> t\n   ```\n\nThis idealized process is mostly mechanical.  Once it is determined\nwhich inputs are static and which are dynamic, the other steps are\nstraightforward.\n\nUnfortunately, following the idealized process often produces poor\nresults, generating large or slow programs.  The remainder of the\nstaing lectures will examine various methods of improving the process\nto generate optimal code.\n\n## Partially-static data\n\n### A closer look at `power`\n\nThe unrolled specialized code generated by the staged `pow` function\nperforms better than the unstaged function.  Nevertheless, there are\nopportunities for improvement.  We start by revisiting the\nbinding-time analysis that led us to add staging annotations to `pow`:\n\n```\nlet rec pow x n =\n  if n = 0 then .< 1 >.\n  else .< .~x * .~(pow x (n - 1)) >.\n```\n\n* `x * pow x (n - 1)` is dynamic because `x` is dynamic\n\n* `pow x (n - 1)` is static because `pow` is static\n\n* `1` is dynamic because the branches must be both static or both dynamic\n\nThe third part of the analysis is not ideal, since `1` is actually\navailable now.  The need to classify it as dynamic arises from the\nbinary static/dynamic distinction.\n\n### Sub-optimal code for `power`\n\nThe crudely-analysed `pow` generates **sub-optimal code**.  For\nexample, the call `pow_code 3` produces the following code:\n\n```\n.<fun x -> x * x * x * 1>. \n```"},{"metadata":{},"input":"pow_code 3","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nwhich contains a wasteful multiplication by `1`.

(We would like to use\n  `PS_monoid` as a drop-in replacement for the monoid `M`, so `ps`\n  must be a monoid, too.)\n\n* `dyn`, `sta` are injections from dynamic and static values into `ps`\n\n* `eva` is a kind of fold over `ps` values: if we have functions `f`\n  and `g` that convert static and dynamic values into values of some\n  other monoid `O.t` then `eva f g` converts `ps` values into values\n  of `O.t`.\n\n(It is instructive to compare the `PS_monoid` interface with the\nintroduction and elimination constructs for binary sums from the\nlambda calculus lectures.)\n\nThe `PS_monoid` looks a lot like `sd`, which also has static and\ndynamic injections; it is easy to write an `eva` for `sd`, too.\n\nBut the `sd` implementation does not make full use of `MONOID` laws.\nFor example,\n\n```\nDyn .<x>. <*> Sta 2) <*> Sta 4\n```\n\nevaluates to\n\n```\nDyn .<(x * 2) * 4>\n```\n\nwhile\n\n```\nDyn .<x>. <*> (Sta 2 <*> Sta 4)\n```\n\nevaluates to\n\n```\nDyn .<x * 8>.\n```\n\nThe two source expressions are equivalent under the commutative monoid\nlaws, and ideally they would generate identical code.\n\n### PS_monoid for integers with multiplication\n\nA law-observing partially-static commutative monoid may be implemented\nas follows.  (For concreteness we will use the commutative monoid of\nintegers with multiplication, but the implementation generalizes\nstraightforwardly to arbitrary commutative monoids.)\n\nFirst, use a product of a static value & bag of variables as the\nrepresentation.  For a static value `s` and variables `x` and `y` that\noccur respectively `n` and `m` times our representation\nis`sx<sup>n</sup>y<sup>m</sup>`.\n\nIn OCaml we start by defining variables as `code` values that support\ncomparison:\n \n```\ntype 'a var\nval compare : 'a var -> 'a var -> int\n```\n\nThen a bag of variables may be represented as a finite map from\nvariables to counts:\n\n```\nmodule IVarMap : Map.S with type key = int var\n```\n\nFinally, the `ps_cmonoid` type may be defined as the product of a\nstatic integer and a bag of variables:\n\n```\ntype ps_cmonoid = int * int IVarMap.t\n```\n\nSince the representation is (almost) canonical, equivalent expressions\nbuilt from `sta`, `dyn` `<*>` and `unit` produce identical results.\n\nFor example,\n\n```\n(sta 2 <*> dyn .<x>.) <*> (sta 4 <*> dyn .<x>.)\n```\n\nevaluates to the representation\n\n```\n(8, {x |-> 2})\n```\n\nand any rearrangement of the operands produces the same result.\n\nAdditionally, since the `ps_cmonoid` only combines dynamic values in\nthe `eva` operation, it is possible to further reduce the number of\nmultiplications in the generated code by avoiding needless\nrecomputation\n\nFor example, whereas a naive implementation of `pow` produces code\nwith 5 multiplications for the exponent `5`:\n\n```\ncd (pow .<x>. 5)\n\n~> .< fun x -> x * x * x * x * x * 1 >.\n```\n\nand an improved implementation reduces the number of muliptlications\nto `4`:\n\n```\ncd (pow .<x>. 5)\n\n~> .< fun x -> x * x * x * x * x >.\n```\n\na careful implementation of `cd` can generate code with only three\nmultiplications:\n\n```\ncd (pow .<x>. 5)\n\n~> .< let y = x*x in let z = y*y in z*x >.\n```\n\n(The implementation itself of the partially-static monoid is left as\nan exercise.  Hint: injections and multiplication are straightforward,\nbut the optimising `cd` based on `eva` requires more thought.)"}],"metadata":{}}],"nbformat":3,"nbformat_minor":0}
